Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 7162
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT *
	FROM user
	WHERE name IS NULL

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

		Looking at the number of fans and the number of reviews, we do not see a direct correlation, since there are users with less reviews and more fans than others.
		This is noticeable in the top 10 reviewers:

		+-----------+---------------+------+
		| name      | review_number | fans |
		+-----------+---------------+------+
		| Kaitlan   |             2 |    3 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	The selected categories were Toronto and Restaurants.
    Overall, we see the results in the city have a larger number of
    4-5 stars than the Restaurants.

    SQL:
        SELECT CASE 
        WHEN b.stars >= 2 AND b.stars <4 THEN '2-3'
        WHEN b.stars >= 4 AND b.stars <=5 THEN '4-5'
        END start_category,b.is_open, COUNT(b.stars) as star_count
        FROM business as b
        LEFT JOIN category as c
        ON b.id = c.business_id
        LEFT JOIN hours as h
        ON b.id = h.business_id
        LEFT JOIN review as r
        ON b.id=r.business_id
        WHERE c.category='Restaurants' AND b.city='Toronto'
        GROUP BY start_category
        ORDER BY star_count DESC;		

    Results:
        +----------------+---------+------------+
        | start_category | is_open | star_count |
        +----------------+---------+------------+
        | 2-3            |       1 |         22 |
        | 4-5            |       1 |         21 |
        | None           |       1 |          1 |
        +----------------+---------+------------+


    Analyzing the city only, we notice a 
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Apparently they are similar.

    | 2-3            |            0 |
    | 4-5            |            0 |
    +----------------+--------------+

SQL:
    SELECT CASE 
    WHEN b.stars >= 2 AND b.stars <4 THEN '2-3'
    WHEN b.stars >= 4 AND b.stars <=5 THEN '4-5'
    END start_category, COUNT(r.id) as review_count

    AND h.hours IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY start_category
    ORDER BY review_count DESC;	
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Not really. First, there are very few business for this category in this city in this database.
Second, many of the existing registries do not contain data for all fields. 


		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
There is no closed Business:

    +---------------+---------+------------+
    | star_category | is_open | star_count |
    +---------------+---------+------------+
    | 4-5           |       1 |         21 |
    | 2-3           |       1 |         22 |
    +---------------+---------+------------+

SQL:
    SELECT CASE 
    WHEN b.stars >= 2 AND b.stars <4 THEN '2-3'
    WHEN b.stars >= 4 AND b.stars <=5 THEN '4-5'
    END star_category, b.is_open, COUNT(b.stars) as star_count
    FROM business as b
    LEFT JOIN category as c
    ON b.id = c.business_id
    LEFT JOIN hours as h
    ON b.id = h.business_id
    LEFT JOIN review as r
    ON b.id=r.business_id
    WHERE c.category='Restaurants' 
    AND b.city='Toronto' 
    AND star_category IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY star_category
    ORDER BY review_count DESC;	
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

	In order to run a text analysis algorithm, we only use the text of the reviews and the id of the review in case we want to use the sentiment information to verify 
	patterns.
    Also, the reviews of the others users for this review might be a good value to try to analyze what kind of
    reviews are better evaluated from other users.

| 4-5           | My brother was in town and wanted to get a quick lunch before I had to go into work. Wanted to go into Monta but it was 11 and they weren't open yet, so we stopped in at the Big Wong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   4.0 |      4 |     1 |    1 |      6 | -3Z4lmpcHpMTzHmm9g8kWw |

|               | Beef Ramen - for 5 you can get a bowl of ramen (same noodles as used at Monta) and it comes with big chunks of beef. They'll ask you for tendons too and I don't remember if they charge you extra, but I don't think so. Came with chili oil, scallions, and siracha on the side. It was good, and it's exactly what you expect to get, ramen and beef. Great flavor and the broth was well seasoned. |       |        |       |      |        |                        |

| 4-5           | My husband and I decided to come here for a Saturday date night. When considering our options, we were sold when we saw the bacon board on the menu. It did not disappoint! It was an excellent and delicious start to our nice (giant) dinner.                                                                                                                                                        |   4.0 |      4 |     0 |    0 |      1 | -0-NjVqdOCyfIyKN_9yKlw |

|               | For our main course we had the BBQ sampler for two, as well as the shrimp and grits appetizer because I just couldn't help myself! The shrimp and grits were simply glorious. I may have preferred grilled or sautéed shrimp, rather than fried, but the other ingredients did a great job of balancing the richness of the fried shrimp and bacon. Marvelous.                                         |       |        |       |      |        |                        |

|               | The sampler was very good, but not amazing. I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile. |       |        |       |      |        |                        |

|               | Since we brought up the missing turkey,  we were given a cobbler desert for free. That's about as much as I would pay for that dessert - $0 - as it tasted like hot, vaguely-fruity mush with a layer of raw flour on top. Whatever... they don't claim to be dessert experts, so what did I expect? I just know better for next time. ;)                                                              |       |        |       |      |        |                        |

|               | Atmosphere is great - cozy, clean and modern. Just hipster enough to feel cool, but not so much to make you feel uncomfortable if you didn't show up with facial hair or a vintage t-shirt. Service is not as attentive as I would prefer, but most likely due to having too much to do, as opposed to a lack of effort. Everyone was very nice.                                                       |       |        |       |      |        |                        |
